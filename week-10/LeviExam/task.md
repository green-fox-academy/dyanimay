<!-- GET /api/questions/ 
- by default responds with all the stored questions in this json format: [{ "id": 1, "question": "What are callback functions in js?" }, {"id": 2, "question": "What day is it?"} ]
- if the limit query parameter is set then it will respond only that amount e.g. GET /api/questions?limit=5 will only send back the 5 recent questions
- if the offset query parameter is set then it will skip the first X questions e.g. GET /api/questions?limit=5&offset=5 will send from the 5th to the 10th question -->

GET / and GET /q/:id are the frontend part of this applicaton and the /api ones are the backend
